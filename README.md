# exPrior

**Ex-situ priors: A Bayesian hierarchical framework for defining informative prior distributions in hydrogeology**

## Overview

The R package *exPrior* implements a Bayesian hierarchical framework for defining informative prior distributions in hydrogeology. You can either use the hydrogeological data from the package or bring your own data, and exPrior will derive the statistical distribution for you.

For more details, including the context and theory behind this package, please refer to [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.02.003) article published in *Advances in Water Resources*, or contact one of the authors (contact information below). A paper focusing on reproducible code examples is in preparation for the R journal.

## Installation

You can install and use this package with the following R commands.

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("kcucchi/exPrior")
```
