Recent papers have made the case that statistics in subsurface hydrology is still falling short on available software tools ([Rubin, 2018](https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/5675/2018/)) and that Bayesian inference is the most relevant framework for subsurface statistics ([Hesse, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00118/full)). The exPrior package, providing tools for Bayesian inference, is therefore a timely addition to the R ecosystem of statistical tools.

The aim of this package is to provide practitioners of Bayesian statistics a tool to derive priors for Bayesian inference in subsurface hydrology. Priors summarize hydro-geological knowledge from studies at similar sites  ([Cucchi, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170818309059)). The main features of the package are:

- generate prior distributions based on external data only, therefore meeting the likelihood principle,
- account for possible autocorrelation in these data,
- account for available soft data, say, in the form of expert information on bounds and moments,
- comes bundled with the largest open-source database on hydro-geological parameters, etc.


## Installation

exPrior v1.0.1 can be installed via CRAN. You can also install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GeoStat-Bayesian/exPrior")
```
## Example

Examples on how to use exPrior can be found in the vignettes in the /vignettes folder.

## Documentation

A publication detailing the algorithm can be found at [Cucchi (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170818309059). A publication detailing the package and how to use it is in preparation.
