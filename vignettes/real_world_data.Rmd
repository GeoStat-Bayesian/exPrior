```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5)
```

This packages provides real-world data on porosity. In this vignette, we are going to exemplify the use of this package using these data.

First, we should load the libraries to get access to this function:

```{r}
library(devtools)
load_all()
library(exPrior)
```

Let us start by importing data on porosity in sandstone aquifers.
 
```{r}
load(file="../data/df_porosity.rda")
```
  
These real-world data can now be used to compute the prior.

```{r}
resExPrior = genExPrior(exdata = df_porosity, theta = seq(from=0, to=1, by=0.01))
```

Here, the range of the `theta` vector reflects the common-sense intuition that porosity values can only be found between `0` and `1`.

After the completion of `exPrior`, we can visualize both the uninformative and informative distribution of $\theta$ using `plotExPrior`. This function again takes as input the output from `genExPrior` as well as a Boolean asking whether to additionally plot the used data.

```{r}
plotHyperDist(resExPrior)
```

Compared to the introductory example, the hyper prior distributions are much narrower, indicating extremely small uncertainty about their values. This small uncertainty is caused by the large amount of data  used for the inference. Next, let us look at the predicted prior distribution.

```{r}
plotExPrior(resExPrior, plotExData = TRUE)
```

As can be seen, the prior distribution for porosity values in sandstone is strongly peaked between `0.2` and `0.3` as determined by the available data. Using this prior can therefore provide a sound foundation for statistical inference. 


<!-- # From the vignette generated by default -->

<!-- Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format: -->

<!-- - Never uses retina figures -->
<!-- - Has a smaller default figure size -->
<!-- - Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style -->

<!-- ## Vignette Info -->

<!-- Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette. -->

<!-- ## Styles -->

<!-- The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows: -->

<!--     output: -->
<!--       rmarkdown::html_vignette: -->
<!--         css: mystyles.css -->

<!-- ## Figures -->

<!-- The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. -->

<!-- ```{r, fig.show='hold'} -->
<!-- plot(1:10) -->
<!-- plot(10:1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML: -->

<!--     output: -->
<!--       rmarkdown::html_vignette: -->
<!--         fig_caption: yes -->

<!-- Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**. -->

<!-- ## More Examples -->

<!-- You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Also a quote using `>`: -->
