Description: The aim of this package is to provide practitioners of geostatistics 
  a tool to derive ex-situ priors for Bayesian inference in hydrogeology. 
  Ex-situ priors summarize hydrogeological knowledge from studies at similar sites. 
  The main features of the package are to (i) generate prior distributions based 
  on external, ie, ex-situ, data only; (ii) to account for possible autocorrelation
  in these ex-situ data, and (iii) to account for available soft data, say, in 
  the form of expert information on bounds and moments.
